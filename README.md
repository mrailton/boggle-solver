# Boggle Solver

This is a basic command line tool that will generate a grid for the popular word game Boggle

It also provides a listing of all words that can be generated via the grid

Running it is simple, just clone the project and then run `python boggle.py`

This was created as a small project when I was a student with https://codeinstitute.net
